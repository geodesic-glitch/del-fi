# Ridgeline Station — Area Overview

## Location & Terrain

Ridgeline Station sits at 9,240 ft elevation in the Colorado Rockies, near the northern edge of the Elk River Valley. The station occupies a forested ridgeline above treeline transition, roughly 4 miles west of the nearest paved road (County Road 129). The nearest town is Clark, CO, approximately 7 miles east.

The terrain is classic subalpine: dense Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir on north-facing slopes, with open south-facing meadows that retain snow well into May. A seasonal creek (Ridgeline Creek) runs through the drainage 300 ft below the station, feeding into the Elk River system. At higher elevations (above 10,500 ft), the zone transitions to alpine tundra.

## Station Infrastructure

The station runs on a 200W solar array with a 400Ah lithium battery bank. In winter, a small wind turbine supplements power during low-sunlight weeks. The station includes: three trail cameras (CAM-1 North Meadow, CAM-2 Creek Crossing, CAM-3 Spruce Hollow), a Davis Instruments Vantage Pro2 weather station on a 10 ft mast, and a Meshtastic LoRa node for mesh communication.

Power status: sufficient through winter with clear skies; marginal during extended overcast periods (>5 days). Generator backup is at the trailhead cache (4 mi east).

## Access

Summer: Accessible via Ridgeline Trail from Clark trailhead. 4.2 miles, ~1,900 ft gain. Moderate.
Winter: Snowmobile or ski access only. Trail is typically buried under 3-5 ft of snow Dec-Apr.
Road closure: County Road 129 closes to vehicles at the Forest Service gate (mile marker 6) around Nov 1 and reopens in late April depending on snowpack.

## Surrounding Protected Areas

The station is within the Routt National Forest boundary, adjacent to the Mount Zirkel Wilderness (~2 miles west). No motorized access within Wilderness boundary. Part of the upper Colorado Rockies wildlife corridor used seasonally by elk, mule deer, and large carnivores including mountain lion and occasional black bear (bear dormant in winter).

## Neighboring Nodes

VALLEY-ORACLE is located at 6,800 ft, 9 miles southeast near the Elk River trailhead. SUMMIT-POST is a unmanned sensor node at 11,100 ft on Hahns Peak, mainly weather data. Both nodes are reachable via Meshtastic mesh.

## General Notes

Wildlife activity peaks at dawn and dusk year-round. The north meadow (CAM-1 zone) is the best single spot for large mammal sightings. The creek crossing (CAM-2) records the highest species diversity due to water access. Predator sign (mountain lion, coyote) concentrates along the ridge above Spruce Hollow.
