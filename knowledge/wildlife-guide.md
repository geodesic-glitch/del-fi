## Large Mammals

### Rocky Mountain Elk (Cervus canadensis nelsoni)
Status: Year-round resident; winter herds are largest.
The dominant large herbivore in the area. A winter herd of 7-15 cows, calves, and young bulls regularly uses the North Meadow (CAM-1). Mature bulls tend to be solitary or in small bachelor groups outside of rut (Sept-Oct). Males shed their antlers in late Feb/early March — shedding begins with youngest animals. Elk are most active at dawn and dusk. Bedding areas visible as oval depressions in snow. Primary food in winter: willow tips, dry grass tips above snow, twigs. Elk are the primary prey base for mountain lions in this area.

### Mule Deer (Odocoileus hemionus)
Status: Year-round; some individuals move to lower elevations in deep winter.
Smaller than elk; distinctive large, bifurcated antlers on bucks. Does and fawns tend to use the aspen/willow edge habitat along creek drainages. Bucks may shed antlers Jan-March. Mule deer are more prone than elk to yarding up in dense timber during storms. They are the main prey of coyotes (especially fawns in spring) and secondary prey for mountain lion.

### Mountain Lion / Cougar (Puma concolor)
Status: Resident; low density (estimated 1 territory every 30-50 sq mi).
The apex predator of the area. Solitary and secretive. Typically crepuscular/nocturnal. Tracks are large round prints ~3-4 inches, no claw marks (retractile claws). Stride is long and fluid. Lions cache large prey kills under debris and snow, returning over several days. An adult female has been photographed at CAM-2 (Creek Crossing) three times in the last 60 days — her territory likely includes the Ridgeline Creek drainage. Encounters with people are very rare. If a lion is seen, maintain eye contact, do not run, and make yourself large.

### Coyote (Canis latrans)
Status: Year-round resident; common.
Smaller than a wolf (35-50 lb), with a pointed muzzle, bushy tail with black tip, and narrow chest. Typically seen solo or in bonded pairs. February is the start of breeding season for coyotes — pairs are active and vocal at night. Primary prey: voles, snowshoe hares, mule deer fawns (spring), carrion. Coyotes cache food and return to it. Tracks are neat, almost in-line (walk/trot), roughly 2-2.5 in long. They will alarm-bark at owls and other predators. Frequently heard howling before dawn in winter.

### Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) — Possible
Status: Rare, range expanding in Colorado since 2021 reintroduction in Routt/Grand Counties.
Larger than coyotes (70-130 lb). Track size: front print 4-5 inches long (vs coyote's 2.5 in). Stride is longer with a more direct register (hind foot lands near front track). Wolves tend to travel in packs and leave a wide trail pattern. Colorado Parks & Wildlife released 10 wolves in Dec 2023 in North Park (roughly 40 miles SE); documented movements have reached Routt National Forest. The Feb 17 large canid sighting at CAM-2 is under investigation. Report all suspected wolf sightings to CPW at 1-800-332-4155.

### Black Bear (Ursus americanus)
Status: Seasonal (April–November). Denning in winter.
Two bears have been photographed at Ridgeline Station in summer/fall. Bears typically enter dens by November at this elevation; emergence usually late March to early April depending on snowpack and temps. Primary fall food: berries (serviceberry, chokecherry), whitebark pine nuts (via nutcracker caches), roots. Bears are not expected in camera frames until late March at earliest.

### Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes)
Status: Year-round; occasional.
Much smaller than coyote (8-15 lb). Distinctive rusty-red coat with white muzzle and white-tipped tail. Winter coat is luxurious. Fox tracks are neat, oval, and nearly in-line. Foxes hunt voles and snowshoe hares using remarkable hearing to locate prey under snow ("mousing behavior" seen at CAM-3). They are generally less bold than coyotes and more likely to be seen at forest edges than in open meadows.

### Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus)
Status: Year-round; population cycles 8-11 years.
Medium-sized hare (3-4 lb) that turns white in winter (brown in summer). Large hind feet act as natural snowshoes. Highly cyclic population — in high years (estimated current population is moderate-to-high for this area) every camera sees one weekly. When hare populations peak, predator populations follow 1-2 years later. Primary prey of Canada lynx, red fox, coyote, great horned owl. Hares create "form" beds in thickets and move along established runs visible as packed channels under snow.

### Ermine / Short-tailed Weasel (Mustela erminea)
Status: Year-round; small and easily missed.
Turns all-white in winter except for the black-tipped tail. Very fast movement, characteristic bounding gait. Body length ~7-10 inches. Pursues prey (voles, mice, snowshoe hares) through tunnels beneath the snowpack (subnivean zone). Often seen briefly at forest edges. Track pattern: paired prints, about 1-2 inches long, bounding stride.

## Birds

### Common Raven (Corvus corax)
Status: Year-round resident; most visible in winter.
Large, all-black corvid. Highly intelligent — ravens follow wolves and large predators to scavenge kills. Two resident ravens at Ridgeline Station appear to have claimed the area; they are regular camera subjects at CAM-2. Ravens will mob owls and eagles. Their calls range from low croaks to high-pitched calls to remarkable mimicry. They cache food and remember where caches are for weeks.

### American Dipper (Cinclus mexicanus)
Status: Year-round on open water; the creek section near CAM-2 provides winter habitat.
Stocky, gray, wren-like bird. The only truly aquatic songbird in North America. Bobs up and down constantly (the "dip"). Walks underwater along the creek bottom, using wings to maintain position against current. Eats aquatic invertebrates and small fish. The open section of Ridgeline Creek hosts one individual through winter — it has been observed in temperatures down to 9°F. Dippers are sensitive to water quality; their presence indicates a healthy creek.

### Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana)
Status: Year-round subalpine resident.
Gray and black bird with white wing patches, slightly larger than a robin. Famous for caching whitebark pine seeds — each bird buries up to 98,000 seeds per fall and retrieves the majority through winter and spring, using a spatial memory that is among the best of any animal. A single nutcracker can recover cached seeds under 3 feet of snow. They are a keystone species for whitebark pine regeneration. Common at Ridgeline Station year-round; most often seen in spruce/fir canopy and atop ridge snags.

### Mountain Chickadee (Poecile gambeli)
Status: Year-round; often the most common bird seen.
Small black-capped bird with a white eyebrow stripe (distinguishes it from the black-capped chickadee). Forages constantly through the canopy, extracting insect eggs and larvae from bark. In winter they roost in tree cavities and can lower their body temperature at night to conserve energy. Observed daily at Ridgeline Station; a flock of 12-15 regularly uses the Spruce Hollow zone.

### Steller's Jay (Cyanocitta stelleri)
Status: Year-round at lower elevations; occasional at 9,200 ft, especially in winter.
The only crested jay in western North America. Dark charcoal with a deep blue-black head crest and blue wings/tail. Bold and curious. Will steal food from campsites. Not typical at Ridgeline Station elevation in winter — the two individuals seen Feb 13 may be moving upslope ahead of a storm.

### Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)
Status: Occasional winter visitor; breeds lower.
Adults have unmistakable white head and tail (full adult plumage at ~5 years). Juveniles are mottled brown. The adult photographed at CAM-1 (Feb 12) was perched on a ridge snag — classic raptor hunting position over an open meadow with vole activity. Eagles at this elevation in winter are following elk/deer herds, watching for carrion or wounded animals on the winter range.

### Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus)
Status: Year-round resident; nocturnal, rarely photographed.
Large owl with prominent ear tufts and yellow eyes. Heard regularly calling in pairs during breeding season (Jan-Feb — they nest earlier than any other Rocky Mountain raptor). Calls: deep "hoo hoo-hoo hoo hoo." Hunts snowshoe hares, voles, mice, smaller birds. A primary predator pressure on snowshoe hares alongside coyote and fox.

## Small Mammals (Burrow/Track Evidence — Not Regularly Camera-Documented)

- **Voles (Microtus spp.):** Abundant under snowpack; foundation of the food web. Runways visible after snowmelt.
- **Deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus):** Remains active under snow all winter. Hantavirus risk — do not disturb nests.
- **Porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum):** Occasional; gnaws bark on conifers in winter. Look for stripped trunk bases.
- **Marten (Martes americana):** Rare; larger than ermine, brown with buff throat patch. Hunts in spruce/fir.

## Predator-Prey Relationships in the Area

Mountain lion preys primarily on elk and mule deer. Coyotes primarily take voles, hares, and deer fawns. Red fox and ermine focus on small rodents and hares. Raven and eagle fill scavenger/opportunist roles. The subnivean (under-snow) rodent community — voles, deer mice — supports fox, ermine, coyote, and owls all winter and is invisible to cameras but is the energy base of the whole winter food web.
