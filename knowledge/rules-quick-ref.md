# Rules Quick Reference — Neon Abyss RPG

## Core Mechanic

Roll **2d6 + modifier**. Compare to target number:
- **6 or less:** Failure — things go wrong.
- **7–9:** Partial success — you do it, but with a cost, complication, or hard choice.
- **10+:** Full success — you do it cleanly.
- **12+:** Critical — exceptional result, bonus effect at GM's discretion.

## Character Stats

Every character has four stats, each ranging from **-1 to +3**:

| Stat | Governs |
|------|---------|
| **CHROME** | Strength, toughness, melee combat, cyberware resilience |
| **REFLEX** | Speed, agility, ranged combat, piloting, stealth |
| **NERVE** | Willpower, intimidation, leadership, resisting fear/pain |
| **SYNAPSE** | Intelligence, hacking, medicine, tech repair, perception |

## Actions

### **Fight** (CHROME or REFLEX)
Engage in violence. CHROME for melee, REFLEX for ranged. On 7–9, you deal damage but take damage or a complication. On 10+, you deal damage cleanly.

### **Sneak** (REFLEX)
Move unseen, pick pockets, bypass physical security. On 7–9, you get through but someone notices something is off.

### **Hack** (SYNAPSE)
Interface with systems, break ICE, extract data. On 7–9, you're in but you trigger a trace or alert. On 10+, clean access.

### **Read the Room** (SYNAPSE)
Assess a situation, spot lies, analyze tech. GM reveals useful information based on roll quality.

### **Persuade** (NERVE)
Convince, threaten, or manipulate someone. On 7–9, they'll do it but want something in return or only partially comply.

### **Endure** (CHROME or NERVE)
Resist damage, toxins, Chrome Sickness, fear, or pain. On 7–9, you push through but take a condition.

### **Jack In** (SYNAPSE)
Enter cyberspace through a neural link. Once jacked in, all Net actions use SYNAPSE. Getting dumped out of the Net (dumpshock) deals 2 damage.

## Health & Damage

- Characters have **6 Hit Points (HP)**.
- Light weapons deal **1 damage**. Heavy weapons deal **2 damage**. Explosives deal **3 damage**.
- **Armor** reduces damage: Light armor (-1), Heavy armor (-2), Subdermal implant (-1, stacks).
- At **0 HP**, you're down and dying. Another character must stabilize you within 2 rounds or you're dead.
- Healing: Medkit restores 2 HP (one use). Hospital rest restores all HP. Stim restores 1 HP but you crash for -1 to all rolls next scene.

## Chrome Sickness

Every piece of cyberware has a **Chrome Cost (CC)** from 1–3. Track total CC:
- **CC 0–4:** Normal.
- **CC 5–7:** Mild symptoms — occasional glitches, emotional flatness. -1 to Persuade.
- **CC 8–9:** Severe — dissociation, paranoia, phantom limb. -1 to NERVE.
- **CC 10+:** Critical — risk of cyberpsychosis. GM may compel violent or erratic behavior.

## Cyberware Examples

| Implant | Effect | Chrome Cost |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Neural Link | Net access, AR overlay | 1 |
| Cyber-Eyes | Low-light vision, zoom, +1 Read the Room | 1 |
| Reflex Booster | +1 REFLEX (always on) | 2 |
| Subdermal Armor | -1 damage taken | 2 |
| Mono-Wire Claws | 2 damage melee, concealable | 2 |
| Cyberdeck (implanted) | +1 Hack, faster jack-in | 2 |
| Loader Arms | +1 CHROME, can lift vehicles | 3 |
| Dermal Chameleon | Near-invisibility, +1 Sneak | 3 |

## Net Combat (Cyberspace)

When jacked in, netrunners navigate virtual architecture. ICE (security programs) acts as enemies:
- **White ICE:** Alarms and tracers. Alerts security.
- **Gray ICE:** Locks you out, scrambles your deck.
- **Black ICE:** Attacks your brain directly. Deals real damage.

Defeating ICE uses the **Hack** action. Taking damage from Black ICE can cause dumpshock (forced disconnect + 2 damage).
