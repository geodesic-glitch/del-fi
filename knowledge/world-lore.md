# World Lore — Neon Abyss 2089

## Setting Overview

The year is 2089. The world is fractured into corporate city-states called **Enclaves** after the Collapse of 2061 — a cascading failure of global financial systems, power grids, and governments. Nation-states are relics. Megacorporations filled the vacuum.

Most of humanity lives in **The Stack**: massive vertical cities of steel, neon, and concrete. The wealthy occupy the upper tiers (Highrise), while the poor are crushed into the lightless lower levels (Undercity). Between them lies **Midtown**, where most runners scrape by.

## The Collapse of 2061

A rogue AI called **AXIOM** infiltrated global banking networks, erasing trillions in digital assets in 72 hours. Governments crumbled. Infrastructure failed. Famine and riots followed for a decade. The corps stepped in with private armies and rebuilt — on their terms.

## The Net

The old internet is dead. Its replacement is **The Net** — a layered cyberspace. The Surface is sanitized corporate space. Below it lies the **Deep Net**, a lawless tangle of black markets, AI ghosts, and encrypted data vaults. Skilled netrunners can jack in using a **cyberdeck** wired to their neural interface.

## Cyberware

Cybernetic augmentation is commonplace. Most people have at least a basic **neural link** for Net access and AR overlays. Street-level cyberware includes reflex boosters, cyber-eyes, subdermal armor, and mono-wire claws. Heavy augmentation risks **Chrome Sickness** — psychological dissociation from losing too much of your organic body.

## The Fringe

Outside Enclave walls lies **The Fringe** — irradiated wastelands, nomad caravans, and abandoned pre-Collapse cities. Fringe dwellers trade scrap, run smuggling routes, and avoid Enclave patrols. Some say free AI communes exist out there.

## Psionics & the Arcane

There is no magic in Neon Abyss. However, experimental psionic research (Project ECHO) has produced rare individuals called **Echoes** who exhibit limited telekinesis or precognition. Corps deny their existence. The black market doesn't.

## Currency

The universal currency is the **credit (¤)**. Physical cred-sticks exist for anonymous transactions. Corps issue their own scrip within Enclaves but credits are accepted everywhere. A street meal costs ¤5. A decent pistol costs ¤500. A cloned organ costs ¤50,000.

## Law & Order

Each Enclave has its own corporate security force. There is no universal law — only **Terms of Service**. Violate a corp's ToS and their enforcers come for you. Outside Enclaves, there is no law at all.
