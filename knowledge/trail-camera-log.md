# Trail Camera Log — Ridgeline Station

Three cameras are active: CAM-1 (North Meadow), CAM-2 (Creek Crossing), CAM-3 (Spruce Hollow). All timestamps are local Mountain Time. Images stored on SD cards, checked monthly. Species confirmed visually unless noted "track only."

## Feb 18, 2026

**06:14 · CAM-1 North Meadow**
Elk herd — 7 individuals. 4 cow elk and 3 younger bulls (no antlers — shed). Browsing willows on east meadow edge. Herd held position for ~25 minutes before moving north toward ridgeline. Very calm behavior. Cows appeared healthy; no signs of injury or predator stress.

**07:03 · CAM-2 Creek Crossing**
Common raven, 2 individuals. Investigating something in the snow near the creek bank — possibly cached food or an old carcass under the snow. Departed at 07:09.

**07:41 · CAM-3 Spruce Hollow**
Mountain chickadee flock — estimated 12-15 birds. High activity in spruce canopy. Typical foraging behavior.

## Feb 17, 2026

**04:33 · CAM-2 Creek Crossing**
Canid — large, gait and track width ambiguous (coyote or gray wolf). Deep snow made direct print measurement unavailable. Animal crossed frame L to R in approximately 3 seconds. Body length appearance (relative to known creek-bank boulder, ~18 in) suggests coyote but cannot rule out wolf. Logged as "coyote/wolf unconfirmed." VALLEY-ORACLE was asked to contact Colorado Parks & Wildlife for area wolf tracking status.

**11:22 · CAM-1 North Meadow**
Mule deer — 2 does. Moving quickly S to N through meadow, heads low into wind. Behavior consistent with mild alarm. No predator visible in frame.

**14:55 · CAM-3 Spruce Hollow**
Red fox. Single individual, classic winter red phase with white-tipped tail. Mousing behavior — paused, cocked head, pounced into snow. Classic vole-hunting technique. Active ~8 minutes, made at least 2 pounces.

**22:10 · CAM-3 Spruce Hollow**
Snowshoe hare — 1 individual. Pure winter white. Moved along the base of the spruce line, stopping frequently. Large hind feet clearly visible in snow. Duration: ~4 minutes.

## Feb 16, 2026

**06:02 · CAM-1 North Meadow**
Elk herd — 11+ individuals. Largest herd observed this week. Included at least 2 spike bulls and one mature 4-point bull that has been seen consistently since early January. Herd grazed through much of the morning. Crystal-clear conditions made for excellent camera captures.

**08:47 · CAM-2 Creek Crossing**
American dipper. Single bird on ice-free rock in creek shallows. Typical dipping behavior. The creek crossing section stays partially open all winter due to spring upwelling. Dipper sightings here are consistent weekly.

**15:30 · CAM-1 North Meadow**
Mule deer — small bachelor group, 3 bucks. All three with full antlers (not yet shed). Beds visible in snow at south meadow edge from overnight.

## Feb 15, 2026

**05:55 · CAM-2 Creek Crossing**
Mountain lion — clear image, one adult. Animal walked directly across the camera field, paused briefly to sniff at the base of a marker post, then continued east. Estimated 90-110 lb, female or subadult male based on size. Track length in fresh snow measured at ~3.5 in (consistent with adult female mountain lion). This is the third lion sighting at Creek Crossing in the past 60 days. No prey carcase located on Feb 16 check.

**07:20 · CAM-1 North Meadow**
Elk — 5 cows. Highly agitated behavior, moving quickly, looking back toward spruce line. Possible response to the mountain lion (which likely passed through earlier that morning). Herd vacated meadow within 2 minutes.

**13:15 · CAM-3 Spruce Hollow**
Clark's nutcracker — 3 birds. Foraging in spruce debris and under canopy. Occasional cache-retrieval behavior observed (bird digs in snow near spruce base). Nutcrackers cache thousands of pine seeds in fall and retrieve them through winter — their memory is extraordinary.

**19:44 · CAM-1 North Meadow**
Coyote — 2 individuals (pair — likely mated pair, breeding season approaching). Brief play behavior observed. Both animals in good winter condition.

## Feb 14, 2026 (Storm Day)

Camera activity reduced dramatically due to heavy snowfall and low ambient light. Many potential events not triggered or not visible in frame. Snow accumulated on CAM-2 lens cap by mid-afternoon; image quality degraded.

**08:30 · CAM-1 North Meadow**
Elk — 3 animals, partially obscured by falling snow. Moving steadily toward lower elevation, likely seeking wind protection during storm.

**16:45 · CAM-3 Spruce Hollow**
Ermine (short-tailed weasel, winter white pelage). Small, fast-moving. Appeared at base of spruce for approximately 20 seconds. Characteristic bounding gait. Likely following snowshoe hare tunnel system beneath the snow.

## Feb 13, 2026

**05:40 · CAM-2 Creek Crossing**
Coyote — solitary. Investigated scent mark from previous night, added its own. Normal territorial behavior before breeding season.

**06:15 · CAM-1 North Meadow**
Elk herd — 9 individuals. Elk fed actively through the morning. Conditions: overcast, light wind, calm. One cow elk limping slightly on right front leg — first observed Feb 10. Possibly minor injury from fall or ice; no signs of advanced lameness or infection.

**14:22 · CAM-3 Spruce Hollow**
Steller's jay — 2 individuals. Unusual to see Steller's jays at this elevation in winter; may be moving upslope from lower areas ahead of the storm.

**21:55 · CAM-2 Creek Crossing**
Unknown event — camera triggered by motion but no animal clearly in frame. Single track set (small rodent or weasel) visible in foreground. Possible wind motion false trigger.

## Feb 12, 2026

**06:50 · CAM-1 North Meadow**
Elk herd — 6 cows with last year's calves (now sub-adults). Classic mixed-sex winter grouping. The injured cow from Feb 13 is in this group; she appeared to be moving more normally on this date.

**09:15 · CAM-2 Creek Crossing**
American dipper — same individual as Feb 16 sighting (distinctive perch preference). Actively diving below surface into the open section. Air temperature was 9°F; dipper was completely unbothered.

**11:45 · CAM-1 North Meadow**
Bald eagle — adult, 2nd year or older (white head visible). Perched in dead snag at north meadow edge for ~40 minutes. Likely hunting for voles or waiting for opportunity near deer/elk. Departed without catching prey.

**18:30 · CAM-2 Creek Crossing**
Snowshoe hare — 2 individuals at creek bank. Brief interaction (sniffing, then going separate ways). Both in full white winter pelage.

## Feb 11, 2026

**06:10 · CAM-1 North Meadow**
Mule deer — 4 does, 1 fawn (born 2025, now well-grown). Does browsing willow tips exposed above snow surface. Fawn appears healthy and independent.

**13:20 · CAM-3 Spruce Hollow**
Red fox — same or similar individual to Feb 17 sighting (same entry point into frame). Patrolling spruce line. No hunting behavior observed this time.

**03:45 · CAM-2 Creek Crossing** (audio trigger)
Coyote heard vocalizing (not in frame). Classic winter howl sequence. Possibly the pair observed Feb 14 and 17.
