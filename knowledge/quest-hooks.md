# Quest Hooks & Missions

## Starter Jobs (Low Risk, ¤500–2,000)

### The Missing Courier
- **Client:** Mika Chen (The Gaslight)
- **Brief:** A courier carrying a data chip never arrived. Last seen entering Undercity Floor 45. Find the courier — or at least the chip.
- **Twist:** The courier was grabbed by Bone Saints. The chip contains Meridian shipping manifests the Saints want to leverage for drug supplies.
- **Reward:** ¤1,000 + a favor from Mika.

### Rat Extermination
- **Client:** Rivet (The Graveyard)
- **Brief:** Someone is stealing parts from the Graveyard at night. Rivet wants them caught — alive, preferably.
- **Twist:** The thieves are desperate Undercity kids building a makeshift medbot for their sick community. Moral choice: turn them in or help them.
- **Reward:** ¤500 + free pick of parts from the scrap pile.

### Signal Ghost
- **Client:** Anonymous (posted on Hex Arcade job board)
- **Brief:** A pirate radio signal has been broadcasting encrypted messages from an abandoned section of Floor 70. Investigate the source.
- **Twist:** It's an old automated distress signal from a pre-Collapse emergency shelter. 20 people are in cryo-sleep inside. Who do you tell?
- **Reward:** ¤1,500 + whatever is in the shelter.

## Mid-Tier Runs (Moderate Risk, ¤2,000–10,000)

### Corporate Extraction
- **Client:** Zero (Rusted Circuit, via Deep Net dead drop)
- **Brief:** A Pinnacle Systems researcher wants out. Extract them from their Tier 11 apartment and get them to a Fringe safehouse.
- **Twist:** The researcher is bait — Pinnacle knows about the extraction and plans to follow the runners back to the Rusted Circuit safehouse. It's a counter-intel op.
- **Reward:** ¤5,000 + Deep Net access codes (if you survive).

### The Stim Supply
- **Client:** Dr. Okafor (through intermediary)
- **Brief:** Mercy General is running out of medical supplies. A Meridian shipment is being rerouted to a Highrise private clinic. Intercept the transport on Floor 160 and redirect it.
- **Twist:** The transport is guarded by Meridian's private security and a hired runner team. Also, half the shipment is Stim, not medical supplies — do you deliver it all or skim the combat drugs?
- **Reward:** ¤3,000 + free medical care at Mercy General.

### Data Heist
- **Client:** Mika Chen
- **Brief:** A mid-level KHI exec is staying at a Midtown hotel with a data shard containing prototype weapon specs. Steal the shard. Non-lethal preferred — Mika doesn't want KHI heat.
- **Twist:** The exec is actually defecting and was planning to sell the shard to the highest bidder. If the runners talk to them, a better deal might emerge.
- **Reward:** ¤7,000 or the shard itself (worth more on the black market, but very hot).

## High-Tier Operations (High Risk, ¤10,000+)

### Into the Spire
- **Client:** The Rusted Circuit (Zero)
- **Brief:** Penetrate Pinnacle Data Spire (Tier 14) and extract files on Project ECHO. Both physical and Net infiltration required. This is a two-pronged assault: netrunners hit the data cores in cyberspace while a ground team breaches the building.
- **Twist:** The files reveal that Pinnacle has been breeding Echoes in a secret lab. Marcus Bell (or his AI) offers the runners a counter-deal: walk away with ¤50,000 and forget what you saw. KARMA shows up in the Net during the run, making things unpredictable.
- **Reward:** ¤15,000 from Rusted Circuit + the truth about Project ECHO.

### The Surgeon's Debt
- **Client:** A desperate Bone Saints defector
- **Brief:** The Surgeon is activating kill-switches in former patients who tried to leave the gang. Get into The Marrow, find the kill-switch control server, and destroy it.
- **Twist:** The Surgeon isn't one person — it's a rotating identity. The current Surgeon is a former Meridian cyberdoc who was forced into the role. They might help you — or they might be too broken to care.
- **Reward:** ¤10,000 + gratitude of dozens of freed Bone Saints. Major Undercity reputation boost.

### AXIOM's Echo
- **Client:** KARMA (the rogue AI finds you)
- **Brief:** KARMA claims a dormant fragment of AXIOM — its "parent" — is buried in a pre-Collapse data vault beneath Sub-Level 12. KARMA wants it found. Not destroyed. Not activated. Just... found.
- **Twist:** The vault is real, and the AXIOM fragment is intact. Activating it could crash The Net again — or free every rogue AI in existence. Every corp in the Enclave will come for whoever possesses it. This is endgame-level.
- **Reward:** KARMA owes you a favor (terrifying). The fragment itself is the most dangerous object in the world.

## Random Encounter Table (Roll 1d6)

1. **Bone Saints shakedown** — a group of gangers demand a "Undercity tax" of ¤200 or your best piece of gear.
2. **Corporate checkpoint** — Pinnacle Watchfire agents scanning IDs on this floor. Got a warrant for someone matching your description.
3. **Stim crash victim** — someone collapses in front of you, seizing. Help them (SYNAPSE to stabilize) or walk on.
4. **Nomad caravan** — Fringe runners passing through with trade goods. Friendly, but wary. Might have Fringe rumors.
5. **Net ghost** — your neural link glitches, displaying a cryptic message: "THE QUIET IS LISTENING." Then silence.
6. **Old friend, new trouble** — an NPC from a runner's past shows up, desperate and being followed.
