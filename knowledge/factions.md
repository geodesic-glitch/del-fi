# Factions & Corporations

## Megacorporations

### Kurosawa Heavy Industries (KHI)
- **Sector:** Military hardware, cyberware, aerospace
- **HQ:** Neo-Tokyo Enclave, Highrise Tier 12
- **Profile:** The largest arms manufacturer on Earth. Supplies private armies for half the Enclaves. Their cyberware division produces the feared **Ronin-class** combat implants. Ruthless corporate culture — employees are "assets."
- **Leader:** CEO Yuki Kurosawa, 4th-generation dynasty head. Rarely seen in public. Rumored to be 80% cybernetic.

### Meridian BioSystems
- **Sector:** Biotech, pharmaceuticals, cloning
- **HQ:** São Paulo Enclave, Tier 8
- **Profile:** Controls 60% of the global organ cloning market. Runs life-extension programs for the ultra-wealthy. Their street-level product **Stim** is a combat drug that doubles reflexes for 10 minutes — then the crash hits hard. Publicly benevolent, privately monstrous.
- **Leader:** Dr. Elara Vasquez, Chief Science Officer (the real power behind the board).

### Pinnacle Systems
- **Sector:** Software, Net infrastructure, AI research
- **HQ:** Neo-Seattle Enclave, Tier 15 (the very top)
- **Profile:** Built and maintains The Net's Surface layer. Secretly developing next-gen AI despite international bans since AXIOM. Their security division, **Watchfire**, runs the most feared ICE (Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics) in cyberspace.
- **Leader:** Marcus Bell, a reclusive tech savant who communicates only through AI proxies.

### Helios Energy Collective
- **Sector:** Energy, fusion power, infrastructure
- **HQ:** Dubai Enclave
- **Profile:** Runs the fusion reactors that power every Enclave. Cross them and the lights go out — literally. Officially neutral in corporate conflicts. Quietly funds Fringe research outposts.
- **Leader:** The Collective Board — seven anonymous directors.

## Underground Factions

### The Rusted Circuit
- **Type:** Hacktivist collective
- **Territory:** Deep Net, Undercity safe houses
- **Goal:** Tear down corporate Net control and free information. They leak corporate secrets, run underground news feeds, and shelter rogue AIs. Decentralized — no single leader. Use the handle **RUST** in the Net.

### The Bone Saints
- **Type:** Undercity gang / cult
- **Territory:** Neo-Seattle Undercity, Levels 1–30
- **Goal:** Control of the Undercity black market. Worship a mysterious figure called **The Surgeon** who provides free cyberware to the desperate — at a hidden cost. Members are identifiable by skeletal tattoos and bone-white cyberware.

### Nomad Collective (Fringe Runners)
- **Type:** Loose alliance of Fringe nomad clans
- **Territory:** The Fringe, especially old I-5 corridor
- **Goal:** Survival, freedom, and trade. They run smuggling caravans between Enclaves, avoiding corporate patrols. Honor-bound culture. Excellent mechanics and scouts.

### Project ECHO Survivors
- **Type:** Secret network of psionic individuals
- **Territory:** Hidden cells in multiple Enclaves
- **Goal:** Survival. Corps want to capture or kill them. They communicate through psionic resonance — no tech needed. Rumored to have a hidden sanctuary called **The Quiet** somewhere in the Fringe.
