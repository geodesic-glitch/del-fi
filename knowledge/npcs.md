## Fixers & Contacts

### Mika Chen — "The Gaslight" Owner
- **Role:** Fixer / information broker
- **Location:** Neon Row, Floor 155
- **Description:** Mid-40s, cybernetic left arm (chrome, visible), short black hair, perpetual smirk. Runs the Gaslight bar — neutral ground for runners. She arranges jobs, brokers intel, and never takes sides. Her word is bond.
- **Personality:** Dry humor, pragmatic, fiercely protective of her bar's neutrality. Doesn't tolerate violence on her floor.
- **Hook:** She always has work. Walk in, order a drink, and she'll size you up.

### Rivet — Scrap Boss
- **Role:** Junk dealer / Undercity power broker
- **Location:** The Graveyard, Floor 12
- **Description:** Massive frame, more chrome than flesh. Both arms replaced with industrial loader arms. Voice like grinding metal. Age unknown — could be 40, could be 70.
- **Personality:** Gruff, transactional, surprisingly fair. Honors deals. Hates corps with a quiet fury.
- **Hook:** Need cheap parts or a place to hide? Rivet's your guy. Just pay the 10%.

### Dust — Fringe Trader

- **Hook:** Best source for Fringe intel and smuggled goods.

## Antagonists

### Yuki Kurosawa — KHI CEO
- **Role:** Corporate tyrant
- **Location:** Neo-Tokyo Enclave (rarely visits Neo-Seattle)
- **Description:** Elegant, ageless (heavy biosculpting), cold eyes. Rumored 80% cybernetic. Speaks softly. Doesn't need to raise her voice — her army does that.
- **Personality:** Calculating, patient, views people as resources. Respects strength.

### Marcus Bell — Pinnacle Systems Founder
- **Role:** Reclusive tech mogul / possible mad scientist
- **Location:** Pinnacle Tower, Tier 15 (never leaves)
- **Description:** No one has seen his real face in 20 years. Communicates through AI proxies called **Bells** — holographic figures in white suits. Some believe Bell is already dead and an AI wears his name.

### The Surgeon — Bone Saints Leader
- **Role:** Cult leader / black-market cybertech

- **Description:** Unknown appearance — always wears a blank white surgical mask and scrubs. Voice is modulated. Could be anyone under there.
- **Personality:** Gentle bedside manner that makes your skin crawl. Offers free cyberware to the desperate. The catch? Implants contain kill-switches and tracking. Bone Saints enforcers collect on debts.
