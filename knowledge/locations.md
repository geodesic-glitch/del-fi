# Locations & Zones — Neo-Seattle Enclave

## The Stack (Vertical City)

Neo-Seattle's Stack is 400 stories tall and 3 miles in diameter. It is divided into tiers:

### Highrise (Tiers 10–15, Floors 250–400)
- Corporate HQs, luxury penthouses, private gardens under glass domes.
- Clean air, natural sunlight, armed security everywhere.
- Access requires corporate citizenship or a Tier Pass (¤10,000/day for visitors).
- **Notable:** Pinnacle Tower (Tier 15) — the tallest point in the Enclave. Off-limits to non-employees.

### Midtown (Tiers 5–9, Floors 100–249)
- Where most people live and work. Crowded, noisy, neon-drenched.
- Mix of legit businesses, gray-market shops, and ramen joints.
- Security is present but stretched thin. Crime happens in the margins.
- **Notable:** The Bazaar (Tier 6, Floor 140) — a sprawling open market. You can buy almost anything if you know who to ask.

### Undercity (Tiers 1–4, Floors 1–99)
- No sunlight. Artificial lighting flickers. Air recyclers strain.
- Overcrowded, dangerous, forgotten by the corps. Gangs run the blocks.
- Cheapest place to live (¤50/month for a coffin pod).
- **Notable:** The Marrow (Tier 2, Floor 30) — Bone Saints territory. Black-market cyberware clinic run by The Surgeon.

### Sub-Levels (Below Floor 1)
- Abandoned construction zones, flooded tunnels, old infrastructure.
- Home to squatters, ferals, and things best not discussed.
- Rumors of a pre-Collapse data vault buried at Sub-Level 12.

## Key Locations

### Neon Row (Midtown, Floor 155)
- Entertainment district. Bars, clubs, braindance parlors, fighting pits.
- **The Gaslight** — a popular runner bar. Owner: Mika Chen. Neutral ground. Good intel, bad whiskey.
- **Hex Arcade** — underground netrunner hangout disguised as a retro game bar.

### Kurosawa Arms Depot (Midtown, Floor 180)
- Legitimate storefront for KHI weapons. Licensed gear only.
- The back room runs off-book sales for those with the right introduction.

### Mercy General (Midtown, Floor 120)
- The only public hospital in Midtown. Perpetually overcrowded.
- Staffed by overworked medtechs and aging autodocs.
- Meridian BioSystems "donates" expired Stim doses here. Side effects not included.

### The Graveyard (Undercity, Floor 12)
- A vast junkyard of decommissioned drones, vehicles, and cyberware.
- Nomad traders pass through here. Good source of cheap parts.
- Controlled by a scrap boss named **Rivet**, who takes a 10% cut of everything.

### Pinnacle Data Spire (Highrise, Tier 14)
- One of the most heavily defended buildings in the Enclave.
- Houses Pinnacle's primary data cores and AI research labs.
- Watchfire ICE in cyberspace. Kill-drones in meatspace. Don't go here unprepared.

### The Fringe Gate (Ground Level)
- Heavily guarded checkpoint at the base of the Stack.
- Only registered nomads and approved cargo pass through.
- Smuggling tunnels riddle the walls — if you know the way.

## The Fringe (Outside the Enclave)

### The Scar
- Irradiated zone 20 miles east. Old military testing ground.
- Dangerous wildlife, abandoned bunkers, and scavenger teams.

### Relay Station 7
- A Fringe outpost on the old I-5 highway, 50 miles south.
- Nomad trading post. Fuel, food, rumors. Run by a woman called **Dust**.

### The Quiet (Location Unknown)
- Rumored sanctuary of Project ECHO survivors.
- No one who isn't an Echo has ever found it — or at least, none have returned.
