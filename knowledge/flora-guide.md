# Flora Guide — Ridgeline Station Area

Vegetation at 9,200 ft in the Northern Colorado Rockies is classified as subalpine forest, dominated by conifers with riparian willow/alder corridors and small natural meadows. Above treeline (roughly 11,500 ft in this range) alpine tundra begins, accessible from the station via a 2+ mile hike.

## Dominant Trees

### Engelmann Spruce (Picea engelmannii)
The most common tree at Ridgeline Station elevation. Tall, narrow spires with scaly grayish-purple bark. Short, stiff blue-green needles that are square in cross-section (roll one between your fingers — it rolls). Cones are papery, about 1-2 inches, hang downward. Dense stands on north-facing slopes create the dark spruce forest that characterizes the subalpine zone. In winter, spruce branches shed snow loads in occasional loud "snowdumps" heard and seen throughout the day. Engelmann spruce are shade tolerant and slow growing — a 6-inch diameter trunk may be 100+ years old.

### Subalpine Fir (Abies lasiocarpa)
Often found mixed with Engelmann spruce; the two species dominate the same zone together. Distinguished from spruce by its smooth greenish-gray bark with resin blisters, flat needles (won't roll), and upright cones (fall apart on the tree rather than dropping whole). Has a spire-like form even more pronounced than spruce. Fir forms "krummholz" (gnarled, wind-pruned mats) at treeline. Very cold tolerant. Often the first tree to establish in avalanche chutes.

### Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides)
Found in groves on south-facing and disturbed slopes, mixed with conifers. Identified in all seasons by smooth white-green bark with black scars. Leaves are perfectly round with flattened petioles that cause them to quiver in the lightest breeze (hence "quaking"). All trees in an aspen grove are typically clones from a single root system — the grove is one organism. Bark is actually nutritious and green beneath the white outer layer; deer and elk regularly browse and strip aspen bark in winter, creating distinctive dark scars 2-5 feet up the trunk. Spectacular gold color in late September/early October.

### Limber Pine (Pinus flexilis)
Found on rocky, windswept ridgelines and exposed slopes — the areas other conifers can't colonize. Identified by long, flexible branches that bend dramatically without breaking in wind and snow. 5-needled pine with stout, resinous cones. Trees at high-wind exposures often become bizarrely sculpted by prevailing winds. Produces large, wingless seeds that Clark's nutcrackers depend on and cache extensively — the two species have a mutualistic relationship that drives limber pine regeneration. Some limber pines are 1,000+ years old.

## Shrubs and Understory

### Willows (Salix spp.) — Multiple species
The dominant shrubs along Ridgeline Creek and in wet meadow areas. Multiple species occur here; most are low-growing (1-4 ft) with flexible stems that stay above the snow in all but deepest years. Willows are critical winter brouse for elk and moose. The exposed branch tips above snow are highly productive food — elk may visit the same willow patches daily. Willows bloom very early in spring (March-April), providing the first pollen for early-emerging insects.

### Alder (Alnus incana — Thinleaf Alder)
In dense thickets along the creek, taller than most willows (6-15 ft). Catkins (seed structures) visible on bare branches all winter — brownish woody clusters. Alder fixes atmospheric nitrogen, enriching soil and supporting diverse plant communities underneath. Excellent cover for snowshoe hares and the birds that hunt them.

### Shrubby Cinquefoil (Dasiphora fruticosa)
Also called potentilla. A low, woody shrub with small yellow rose-like flowers in summer. Very common in meadow margins and rocky areas. Stays dormant and gray-brown through winter. Wildlife significance: seeds persist through winter, some bird foraging.

### Gooseberry / Currant (Ribes spp.)
Scattered through the understory. Spiny stems. Berries are critical late-summer food for bears before denning. In winter, just bare spiny twigs.

### Snowberry (Symphoricarpos spp.)
Thicket-forming shrub with white, slightly toxic berries that persist through winter. Berries occasionally eaten by grouse and birds. White berries on the snowy ground are one of the distinctive mid-winter sights in this forest.

## Ground Cover and Herbaceous Plants

Most herbaceous (non-woody) plants are dormant and snow-covered from November through May at this elevation, but they define the visual character of the area in summer.

### Heartleaf Arnica (Arnica cordifolia)
One of the most abundant wildflowers in the spruce-fir understory. Bright yellow daisy-like flowers in June-July. Heart-shaped basal leaves. Common in the shaded forest floor beneath the spruce canopy.

### Subalpine Larkspur (Delphinium barbeyi)
Tall, blue-purple flower stalks, July-August, in moist meadows. Highly toxic to cattle but safe for elk and deer if consumed in small amounts. One of the signature flowers of the Colorado subalpine.

### Fireweed (Chamerion angustifolium)
Colonizes disturbed areas and avalanche chutes. Brilliant magenta flowers mid-summer. The first plant to recolonize burned or cleared ground. A bloom of fireweed marks where a disturbance occurred.

### Elk Sedge (Carex geyeri)
An evergreen sedge that stays green beneath the snow and provides critical dry-matter nutrition for elk and deer pawing through snow in winter. Along with willow tips, it is the main winter food source for large herbivores at this elevation. Grows in dense clumps on gentle slopes and meadow edges.

## Lichens and Mosses

### Map Lichen (Rhizocarpon geographicum)
Bright yellow-green crust lichen on exposed rock faces. Used by geologists for lichen dating (lichenometry). Very slow growing — a patch the size of a quarter could be 200-400 years old. Unmistakable color against gray granite.

### Reindeer Lichen (Cladonia rangiferina)
Pale gray-green, branching, shrubby lichen that forms mats on the forest floor between trees. Critical winter food for caribou/reindeer (not present here, but the species is). Present in the Spruce Hollow zone. Extremely sensitive to air pollution; its presence is an indicator of clean air.

## Trees as Wildlife Habitat

- Dead snags (standing dead trees): Essential habitat for cavity-nesting birds and roosting owls. The station area has several large spruce snags that are season-round perches for ravens and eagles.
- Downed logs: Provide cover for small mammals and insects; ermine and weasels hunt under and along logs.
- Elk-rubbed aspens: Aspens with stripped bark (dark patches 2-6 ft up) were rubbed by bull elk during rut. Fresh rubs in fall indicate recent bull presence.
- Porcupine gnaw sign: Look for trees with bark stripped from trunks in geometric patches, especially on subalpine fir and spruce. Recent gnawing is pale yellow-white; old gnawing is gray.
