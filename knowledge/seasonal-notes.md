# Seasonal Notes — Ridgeline Station

A calendar of what to expect through the year at 9,200 ft in the Northern Colorado Rockies.

---

## Winter (December – March)

### Weather
December and January are typically the coldest months. February begins the slow warming trend but remains solidly winter at this elevation. Snowpack builds through late February; peak snowpack usually occurs in late March to early April. Average snow depths in March: 40-55 inches. Expect temperatures below 0°F on the coldest nights (-15°F to -28°F possible in cold winters). Wind chill is consistently below -10°F during storms.

### Wildlife Activity
Winter is when large mammal sightings peak on cameras, because animals concentrate on lower, accessible forage. Elk herds are most cohesive in winter; the North Meadow herd (CAM-1) uses the same area daily. Mule deer are present but may drop to lower elevations in the deepest snow years. Coyotes are most vocal in January-February (breeding season). Mountain lion remain active year-round. Great horned owls begin courtship calling in January. Ravens are highly visible at carcasses and along elk herds.

### Wildlife to Watch For (Winter)
Elk herds, mule deer, coyote pairs (breeding), snowshoe hare (white phase), ermine (white phase), mountain chickadee flocks, Clark's nutcracker, common raven, occasional bald eagle, mountain lion (nocturnal, rare camera captures). Bear, ground squirrels, and chipmunks are all in hibernation or torpor — expect zero camera captures of these species December through March.

### Hazard Notes
- **Avalanche season** begins with first heavy snowfall (typically November) and extends through April. The chute above Spruce Hollow has avalanched in 3 of the last 10 winters. Monitor snowpack instability: new loading (6+ inches in 24 hrs), wind slab formation, and large temperature swings are the main triggers.
- **Cold injury to equipment:** Camera battery performance drops significantly below 0°F. Photos may be blank (battery death mid-shot). Heated enclosures mitigate this.
- **Road/trail closure:** Ridgeline Trail inaccessible without snowshoes/skis from approximately Nov 15 to April 30.

## Spring (April – May)

### Weather
April is still deeply winter at the station. Snow is typically still 20-40 inches deep in early April. Temperatures warm noticeably — highs reaching the 40s°F on clear days — but lows remain below freezing through May at elevation. Snowmelt accelerates dramatically in late April and May. Ridgeline Creek runs high and fast during snowmelt (typically peak runoff: May 10-25 depending on year). Late snowstorms ("spring blizzards") occur in April and even May; one of the largest snowfalls in station history was 19 inches on May 4, 2020.

### Wildlife Activity
Spring is the most dramatic season for wildlife activity. Bears emerge from dens typically late March to mid-April — exact timing depends on snowpack and individual animal. Bears are highly active immediately after emergence, seeking the first green vegetation and carrion. Elk calving begins late May; calves are born in the meadows and forest edges. Do not approach newborn calves — cows are aggressively protective. Migratory birds begin arriving: American robin (late March), mountain bluebird (late March-April), Lincoln's sparrow (May), Wilson's warbler (May). Canada geese occasionally fly over but do not nest at this elevation.

### Flora
Willows are the first plants to show green, often in early April while snow is still deep. Aspen buds break late April. Elk sedge greens up rapidly at the edges of snowmelt. Heartleaf arnica flowers first in late May, usually within days of snowmelt in the understory. Ground is intensely wet through May; social trails become muddy.

### Camera Activity
Spring triggers the highest camera activity of the year. Bears trigger CAM-2 and CAM-3 frequently in April-May. Bull elk move back into higher elevations as snow recedes. Coyotes with pups begin appearing (late May). Raptors hunting snowmelt meadows for voles.

## Summer (June – August)

### Weather
Short and dramatic. June is still cold at this elevation — frosts common through mid-June, occasional snow in early June. July and August are warm (highs 55-70°F), with intense afternoon thunderstorms almost daily from late June through August. Lightning is a serious hazard above treeline. Nights cool to the 30s°F even in July. No month is frost-free at the station.

### Wildlife Activity
Summer is the most species-rich season but large mammals are harder to find — they disperse across a much larger area as feeding is excellent everywhere. Bull elk are in velvet (growing antlers) June-August. Wildflower-dependent insects peak July-August. Breeding birds are nesting June-July; disturbance during this period should be minimized. Hummingbirds (broad-tailed most common) arrive with wildflower bloom (late June) and depart by September. Marmots and ground squirrels are active May-September.

### Flora — Peak Bloom Timeline
- Late May: Elk sedge, willow (pollen), first arnicas
- June: Larkspur, Colorado blue columbine (state flower), American bistort, cow parsnip
- July: Fireweed, pearly everlasting, yarrow, lupine, paintbrush — peak overall diversity
- August: Late goldenrods, asters, gentian — season winding down
- September: Aspen gold; willows yellow; final seed dispersal

### Hazards
- **Lightning:** Common afternoons July-August. Do not be on a ridge or above treeline after noon in summer.
- **Flash flooding:** Ridgeline Creek can rise 2-3 feet in 30 minutes during intense storms. The creek crossing is impassable in major events.
- **Biting insects:** Mosquitoes peak June-July after snowmelt. Horse flies and deer flies peak July-August in meadows. Head protection and long sleeves recommended.

## Fall (September – November)

### Weather
September is beautiful: cool, dry, stable. October brings the first hard frosts and the possibility of early snowstorms (first snow at the station typically arrives Oct 1-15). Night temperatures fall rapidly — sub-freezing by mid-October. November is transitional winter. Trail access begins to close by late November.

### Wildlife Activity — Peak Season
Fall is the most exciting wildlife season. Elk rut peaks in late September. Bull elk bugle loudly from dusk to dawn and into mid-morning — the bugling carries for miles in the cool air. Bulls compete for harems, displaying, wrestling, and occasionally fighting seriously. Cows are constantly moving. Camera captures at CAM-1 (North Meadow) are outstanding during rut.

Bears are in hyperphagia (intense feeding) through October, gaining weight for denning. Berries, nuts, roots, and any available calorie source. Bears may travel 30+ miles per day during hyperphagia and are at their most visible and least cautious.

Clark's nutcrackers are at maximum activity caching pine seeds in September-October. Watch for repeated trips to limber pine and whitebark pine.

The first flocks of migratory finches (pine siskin, crossbills) pass through September-October. Mountain bluebirds depart late September.

### Flora
Aspens peak gold color typically September 20-October 5 at this elevation (slightly earlier than lower elevations; later than treeline). Duration is 1-2 weeks; peak is closely matched to night temperatures and elevation. Willows yellow simultaneously. By early October, leaves are down. Berries (serviceberry, chokecherry, mountain ash lower down) have been stripped by bears and birds.

### Hazards
- **Bears:** Most bears are seen in fall as they fatten up. Do not leave food unattended near the station.
- **Hunting season:** Elk rifle season typically runs late October-November in this zone. Bright orange is standard practice. Check current Colorado Parks & Wildlife season dates.
- **Early winter:** A heavy October snowstorm (6+ inches) can trap unprepared hikers. Plan for winter conditions any time after October 1 at this elevation.
